Description: This package provides functions for computing the asymptotic variance of the Shannon Permutation Entropy taking into account the sequential dependence of the ordinal patterns. Additionally, it provides functions for the asymptotic entropy under the Multinomial model (without serial dependence). It only works for embedding dimension D=3.
