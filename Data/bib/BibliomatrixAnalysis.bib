  abstract      = {Context. Sheath regions ahead of interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) are compressed and turbulent global heliospheric structures. Their global and fine-scale structure are outstanding research problems, and only a few studies have been conducted on this topic closer to the Sun than 1 au. Comprehensive knowledge of the sheath structure and embedded fluctuations and of their evolution in interplanetary space is important for understanding their geoeffectiveness, their role in accelerating charged particles to high energies, the interaction of ICMEs with the ambient wind, and the transport of energy between boundaries. Aims. Our key aims are to investigate in detail the overall structure, as well as nature (stochastic, chaotic, or periodic) and origin, of magnetic fluctuations within a sheath ahead of a slow ICME in the inner heliosphere. Methods. We used magnetic field and plasma observations from the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) during a sheath region observed at similar to 0.5 au on March 15, 2019, ahead of a slow and slowly expanding streamer blow-out CME bracketed between a slower and faster stream. To examine the magnetohydrodynamic-scale turbulent properties, we present an analysis of the fluctuation amplitudes, magnetic compressibility of fluctuations, partial variance of increments (PVI), normalised cross helicity (sigma(c)), and normalised residual energy (sigma(r)). We also conducted a Jensen-Shannon permutation entropy and complexity analysis. Results. The investigated sheath consisted of slower and faster flows that were separated by a brief (similar to 15 min) change in the magnetic sector bounded by current sheet crossings and a velocity shear zone. The fluctuation amplitudes and frequency of high PVI values were larger and higher throughout the sheath than in the upstream wind and had dominantly negative sigma(r) and strongly positive sigma(c). The velocity shear region marked a strong increase in temperature and specific entropy, and the following faster flow had large local patches of positive sigma(r) as well as larger fluctuation amplitudes and higher PVI values, in particular at smaller timescales. Fluctuations in the preceding wind and in the sheath were found to be stochastic. However, sheath fluctuations showed lower entropy and higher complexity, with entropy showing a reducing and complexity an increasing trend with increasing time lag. Conclusions. The two-part sheath structure was likely a result of a warp in the heliospheric current sheet (HCS) that was swept up and compressed into the sheath. The driving ejecta accelerated and heated the wind at the back of the sheath, which then interacted with the slower wind ahead of the HCS warp. This also caused some distinct differences in fluctuation properties across the sheath. Sheaths of slow ICMEs originating as streamer blow-outs can thus have complex structure where fluctuation properties are not just downstream shock properties, but are generated within the sheath. At short timescales, fluctuations feature fully developed and imbalanced MHD turbulence, while at longer scales, fluctuations are increasingly dominated by intermittent coherent and ordered structures.},

  abstract      = {Accurate and reliable runoff forecast is beneficial to watershed planning and management and scientific operation of water resources system. However, due to the comprehensive influence of climatic conditions, geographical environment, and human activities, the runoff series is nonlinear and non-stationary, and there are still great challenges in mid-long term runoff forecasting. In order to improve the prediction accuracy, a novel model TVF-EMD-PE-PSO-GRU (TEPPG) was proposed in this study. Firstly, several intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) were obtained by decomposing the original runoff series by time-varying filter-based empirical mode decomposition (TVF-EMD). Secondly, the permutation entropy (PE) algorithm was used to calculate the complexity of each IMF, and the IMF with similar complexity was combined. Then, the gated recurrent unit (GRU) model based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) was used to predict each IMF after merging. Finally, the prediction results of each IMF were superimposed to obtain the final results. And compared with three models such as TVF-EMD-PSO-GRU, extreme-point symmetric mode decomposition coupled gated recurrent unit and particle swarm optimization (ESMD-PSO-GRU), complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise coupled gated recurrent unit, and particle swarm optimization (CEEMDAN-PSO-GRU). The monthly and annual runoff forecasting of Tangnaihai hydrological station in the upper reaches of the Yellow River and Cuntan hydrological station in the upstream of the Yangtze River was taken as examples to test the performance of the model. The results show that, compared with the other three models, the TEPPG model had the highest prediction accuracy and was relatively stable in both monthly and annual runoff forecasts. Thus, the proposed method was developed to support the decision-making of water resource system.},

  abstract      = {Identifying and characterising dynamical regime shifts, critical transitions or potential tipping points in palaeoclimate time series is relevant for improving the understanding of often highly nonlinear Earth system dynamics. Beyond linear changes in time series properties such as mean, variance, or trend, these nonlinear regime shifts can manifest as changes in signal predictability, regularity, complexity, or higher-order stochastic properties such as multi-stability. In recent years, several classes of methods have been put forward to study these critical transitions in time series data that are based on concepts from nonlinear dynamics, complex systems science, information theory, and stochastic analysis. These include approaches such as phase space-based recurrence plots and recurrence networks, visibility graphs, order pattern-based entropies, and stochastic modelling. Here, we review and compare in detail several prominent methods from these fields by applying them to the same set of marine palaeoclimate proxy records of African climate variations during the past 5 million years. Applying these methods, we observe notable nonlinear transitions in palaeoclimate dynamics in these marine proxy records and discuss them in the context of important climate events and regimes such as phases of intensified Walker circulation, marine isotope stage M2, the onset of northern hemisphere glaciation and the mid-Pleistocene transition. We find that the studied approaches complement each other by allowing us to point out distinct aspects of dynamical regime shifts in palaeoclimate time series. We also detect significant correlations of these nonlinear regime shift indicators with variations of Earth's orbit, suggesting the latter as potential triggers of nonlinear transitions in palaeoclimate. Overall, the presented study underlines the potentials of nonlinear time series analysis approaches to provide complementary information on dynamical regime shifts in palaeoclimate and their driving processes that cannot be revealed by linear statistics or eyeball inspection of the data alone.

  abstract      = {Global warming is posed to modify the modes of variability that control much of the climate predictability at seasonal to interannual scales. The quantification of changes in climate predictability over any given amount of time, however, remains challenging. Here we build upon recent advances in non-linear dynamical systems theory and introduce the climate community to an information entropy quantifier based on recurrence. The entropy, or complexity of a system is associated with microstates that recur over time in the time-series that define the system, and therefore to its predictability potential. A computationally fast method to evaluate the entropy is applied to the investigation of the information entropy of sea surface temperature in the tropical Pacific and Indian Oceans, focusing on boreal fall. In this season the predictability of the basins is controlled by two regularly varying non-linear oscillations, the El Nino-Southern Oscillation and the Indian Ocean Dipole. We compute and compare the entropy in simulations from the CMIP5 catalog from the historical period and RCP8.5 scenario, and in reanalysis datasets. Discrepancies are found between the models and the reanalysis, and no robust changes in predictability can be identified in future projections. The Indian Ocean and the equatorial Pacific emerge as troublesome areas where the modeled entropy differs the most from that of the reanalysis in many models. A brief investigation of the source of the bias points to a poor representation of the ocean mean state and basins' connectivity at the Indonesian Throughflow.},

More specifically, we generalize a traditional statistical complexity measure (SCM) based on permutation entropy by explicitly disclosing heterogeneous frequencies of ordinal pattern transitions. To demonstrate the usefulness of these generalized SCMs, we employ them to characterize different dynamical transitions in the logistic map as a paradigmatic model system, as well as real-world time series of fluid experiments and electrocardiogram recordings. The obtained results for both artificial and experimental data demonstrate that the consideration of transition frequencies between different ordinal patterns leads to dynamically meaningful estimates of SCMs, which provide prospective tools for the analysis of observational time series.},

Accurate prediction of annual sediment concentration in the lower Yellow River can provide a theoretical basis for flood control and disaster reduction and rational utilization of water and soil resources in the lower Yellow River. For the defects of pseudo-components in data decomposition of Complementary EEMD, the Modified EEMD (MEEMD) method proposed in this paper has the advantage of eliminating pseudo components of IMF and reducing non-stationarity of sediment bearing sequences. Then, combined with the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model with strong approximation ability to the stationary sequence, the MEEMD-ARIMA model for predicting the annual sediment concentration in the lower Yellow River was constructed. Through fitting and predicting the annual sediment concentration in Gaocun Station, it is shown that the model not only considers the evolution of sediment concentration in various frequency domains, but also solves the problem that the ARIMA model requires sequence to be stable, the relative error of prediction is within +/- 6\%, and the prediction accuracy is high, thus providing a new method for the prediction of sediment concentration.},

This study aims to measure streamflow complexity in the headwater areas of the TP and investigate the coupling effects of climatic variables (i.e., precipitation and air temperature) on the streamflow complexity across multiple timescales. Using daily streamflow records, we employ permutation entropy as the measure of annual streamflow complexity in the upper Heihe River (UHR) watershed in the northeastern TP from 1960 to 2014. Additionally, wavelet coherence is applied to evaluate the impact of climate (i.e., precipitation and temperature) change. Our results show: (1) due to climate change, streamflow complexity has significantly increased since 1972 in the UHR watershed; (2) the periods of warmer and wetter weather have a longer-term influence on streamflow complexity. Specifically, before 1972, dryer, colder weather in the TP would significantly affect the complexity of the streamflow every three to four years, but after that date, these climatic events occurred less frequently, with gaps of between eight and twelve years, during which the weather was much warmer and wetter; and (3) the influence of precipitation on the streamflow complexity decreased, while that of air temperature increased. Therefore, the impact of climate change on streamflow complexity relating to the dynamic structure of streamflow should be regarded as significant to the work of hydrologists and water resource management agencies.},

Characterizing the recent extreme drought events and uncovering the influence from the surrounding oceans remain to be big challenges. The physical mechanisms of extreme drought events in the NEB are due to varying interacting time scales from the surrounding tropical oceans (Pacific and Atlantic). From time series observations, we propose a three-step strategy to establish the episodic coupling directions on intraseasonal time scales from the ocean to the precipitation patterns in the NEB, focusing on the distinctive roles of the oceans during the recent extreme drought events of 2012-2013 and 2015-2016. Our algorithm involves the following: (i) computing drought period length from daily precipitation anomalies to capture extreme drought events; (ii) characterizing the episodic coupling delays from the surrounding oceans to the precipitation by applying the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) of complexity measure, which is based on ordinal partition transition network representation of time series; and (iii) calculating the ratio of high temperature in the ocean during the extreme drought events with proper time lags that are identified by KLD measures. From the viewpoint of climatology, our analysis provides data-based evidence of showing significant influence from the North Atlantic in 2012-2013 to the NEB, but in 2015-2016, the Pacific played a dominant role than that of the Atlantic. The episodic intraseasonal time scale properties are potential for monitoring and forecasting droughts in the NEB in order to propose strategies for drought impacts reduction.},

  abstract      = {Recurrence entropy (S) is a novel time series quantifier based on recurrence microstates. Here we show for the first time that max(S) can be used as a parameter-free quantifier of short and long-term memories (time-correlations) of stochastic and chaotic signals. max(S) can also evaluate properties of the distribution function of the data set that are not related to time correlation. To illustrate this fact, we show that even shuffled versions of distinct time correlated stochastic signals lead to different, but coherently varying, values of max(S). Such a property of max(S) is associated to its ability to quantify in how many ways distinct short recurrence sequences can be found in time series. Applied to a deterministic dissipative system, the method brings evidence about the attractor properties and the degree of chaoticity. We conclude that the development of a new parameter-free quantifier of stochastic and chaotic time series can open new perspectives to stochastic data and deterministic time series analyses and may find applications in many areas of science.

The analysis of its spatial and temporal variation is of great significance to evaluate prediction uncertainty of the regional temperature trends and the climate change. In this study, annual-TFC from 1979-2017 and seasonal-TFC from 1983-2017 in China were calculated by permutation entropy (PE). Their temporal trend is described by the Mann-Kendall method. Driving factors of their spatial variations are explored through GeoDetector. The results show that: (1). TFC shows a downward trend generally, with obvious time variation. (2). The spatial variation of TFC is mainly manifested in the differences among the five sub-regions in China. There is low uncertainty in the short-term temperature trends in the northwest and southeast. The northeastern and southwestern regions show high uncertainties. TFC in the central region is moderate. (3). The vegetation is the main factor of spatial variation, followed by the climate and altitude, and the latitude and terrain display the lowest impact. The interactions of vegetation-altitude, vegetation-climate and altitude-latitude can interpret more than 50\% of the spatial variations. These results provide insights into causes and mechanisms of the complexity of the climate system. They can help to determine the influencing process of various factors.},

The intrinsic predictability tells us whether there are more predictive structures in DTR fluctuations and to what extent the maximal predictability can be reached. The realizable predictability measures the degree of prediction to which adopted model reaches. Results show that there is a well defined regime-dependent pattern between the intrinsic predictability and the realizable predictability in DTR fluctuations, and both the intrinsic predictability and the realizable predictability in DTR fluctuations over China are overall South-North (with the dividing line around the latitude of 37 degrees N and almost along the Yellow River, and south and north to this line are called southern China and northern China in this study) asymmetric with higher predictability in southern China and weaker predictability in northern China. This South-North contrasting predictability behavior is closely related to the DTR's South-North asymmetric multi-fractal behavior. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract      = {Turbulent magnetic field fluctuations in the solar wind have been extensively investigated, but few studies have analyzed their complexity. Jensen-Shannon complexity maps of time series data provide a mathematical tool that can characterize fluctuations in laboratory experiments as stochastic, chaotic, or periodic phenomena. We apply this recently developed tool to characterize stochastic behavior in solar wind structures, including interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs), co-rotating interactions regions (CIRs), and turbulent magnetic fluctuation intervals. We find that the turbulent intervals observed by Helios, Wind, and Ulysses lie within the stochastic region of the complexity maps and that their complexity decreases while their normalized entropy increases with distance from the Sun. The complexity values associated with the fast solar wind ({\textgreater}550 km s(-1)) turbulence identified in Ulysses data beyond 5 au are highest at low latitudes ({\textless}10 degrees) and lowest at latitudes above 20 degrees. The Jensen-Shannon complexity maps show that fluctuations in the magnetic field, plasma flow, and density of the solar wind at 1 au are stochastic in ICMEs and CIRs identified in Wind data. Our analysis of Ulysses data between 1.4 and 5.4 au shows that the complexity of the ICMEs decreases with distance from the Sun, and the normalized entropy increases. Furthermore, the complexity values associated with magnetic field fluctuations in ICMEs identified in Ulysses data behave like the slow solar wind turbulence fluctuations within 4 au and take on values closer to the complexity values of the fast solar wind beyond 4 au.},

  abstract      = {Ramp-like structures in various atmospheric surface layer time series have been long studied, but the presence of motifs with the finer scale embedded within larger scale ramp-like structures has largely been overlooked in the reported literature. Here a novel, objective and well-adapted methodology, the ordinal pattern analysis, is adopted to study the finer-scaled motifs in atmospheric boundary-layer (ABL) time series. The studies show that the motifs represented by different ordinal patterns take clustering properties and 6 dominated motifs out of the whole 24 motifs account for about 45\% of the time series under particular scales, which indicates the higher contribution of motifs with the finer scale to the series. Further studies indicate that motif statistics are similar for both stable conditions and unstable conditions at larger scales, but large discrepancies are found at smaller scales, and the frequencies of motifs "1234" and/or "4321" are a bit higher under stable conditions than unstable conditions. Under stable conditions, there are great changes for the occurrence frequencies of motifs "1234" and "4321", where the occurrence frequencies of motif "1234" decrease from nearly 24\% to 4.5\% with the scale factor increasing, and the occurrence frequencies of motif "4321" change nonlinearly with the scale increasing. These great differences of dominated motifs change with scale can be taken as an indicator to quantify the flow structure changes under different stability conditions, and motif entropy can be defined just by only 6 dominated motifs to quantify this time-scale independent property of the motifs. All these results suggest that the defined scale of motifs with the finer scale should be carefully taken into consideration in the interpretation of turbulence coherent structures.

Multiyear persistence of similar variants and accumulating evidences of existence of multigenic traits indicates that influenza viruses operate as integrated units and not only as sets of distinct genes. However, there is still no consensus on whether it is the case, and to what extent. One of the main problems is the lack of framework for analyzing and interpreting large body of available high dimensional genomic, clinical and epidemiological data. By reducing dimensionality of data we intend to show whether in addition to gene-centric selective pressure, the evolution of influenza RNA segments is also shaped by their mutual interactions. Therefore, we will analyze how different complexity/entropy measures (Shannon entropy, topological entropy and Lempel-Ziv complexity) can be used to study evolution of nucleotide segments of different influenza subtypes, while reducing data dimensionality. We show that, at the nucleotide level, multiyear clusters of genome-wide entropy/complexity correlations emerged during the H1N1 pandemic in 2009. Our data are the first empirical results that indirectly support the suggestion that a component of influenza evolutionary dynamics involves correlation between RNA segments. Of all used complexity/entropy measures, Shannon entropy shows the best correlation with epidemiological data.},

We found a tendency that eastward flow of information is preferred only for oceanic variables, which is a main characteristic of the ACW, an eastward wave making a circuit around the Antarctica. Since the ACW is the coherent pattern in both ocean and atmosphere it is reasonable to infer that the tendency reflects the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) encircling the Antarctica, rather than an evidence of the ACW. We observed one common feature for all four variables, a strong information flow over the area of the eastern Pacific Ocean, which suggest a signature of El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO).

  abstract      = {The use of information measures for model selection in geophysical models with subgrid parameterizations is examined. Although the resolved dynamical equations of atmospheric or oceanic global numerical models are well established, the development and evaluation of parameterizations that represent subgrid-scale effects pose a big challenge. For climate studies, the parameters or parameterizations are usually selected according to a root-mean-square error criterion that measures the differences between the model-state evolution and observations along the trajectory. However, inaccurate initial conditions and systematic model errors contaminate root-mean-square error measures. In this work, information theory quantifiers, in particular Shannon entropy, statistical complexity, and Jensen-Shannon divergence, are evaluated as measures of the model dynamics. An ordinal analysis is conducted using the Bandt-Pompe symbolic data reduction in the signals. The proposed ordinal information measures are examined in the two-scale Lorenz-96 system. By comparing the two-scale Lorenz-96 system signals with a one-scale Lorenz-96 system with deterministic and stochastic parameterizations, the study shows that information measures are able to select the correct model and to distinguish the parameterizations, including the degree of stochasticity that results in the closest model dynamics to the two-scale Lorenz-96 system.},

  abstract      = {Accurate model representation of land-atmosphere carbon fluxes is essential for climate projections. However, the exact responses of carbon cycle processes to climatic drivers often remain uncertain. Presently, knowledge derived from experiments, complemented by a steadily evolving body of mechanistic theory, provides the main basis for developing such models. The strongly increasing availability of measurements may facilitate new ways of identifying suitable model structures using machine learning. Here, we explore the potential of gene expression programming (GEP) to derive relevant model formulations based solely on the signals present in data by automatically applying various mathematical transformations to potential predictors and repeatedly evolving the resulting model structures. In contrast to most other machine learning regression techniques, the GEP approach generates "readable" models that allow for prediction and possibly for interpretation. Our study is based on two cases: artificially generated data and real observations. Simulations based on artificial data show that GEP is successful in identifying prescribed functions, with the prediction capacity of the models comparable to four state-of-the-art machine learning methods (random forests, support vector machines, artificial neural networks, and kernel ridge regressions). Based on real observations we explore the responses of the different components of terrestrial respiration at an oak forest in south-eastern England. We find that the GEP-retrieved models are often better in prediction than some established respiration models. Based on their structures, we find previously unconsidered exponential dependencies of respiration on seasonal ecosystem carbon assimilation and water dynamics. We noticed that the GEP models are only partly portable across respiration components, the identification of a "general" terrestrial respiration model possibly prevented by equifinality issues. Overall, GEP is a promising tool for uncovering new model structures for terrestrial ecology in the data-rich era, complementing more traditional modelling approaches.},

  abstract      = {Data analysis and model-data comparisons in the environmental sciences require diagnostic measures that quantify time series dynamics and structure, and are robust to noise in observational data. This paper investigates the temporal dynamics of environmental time series using measures quantifying their information content and complexity. The measures are used to classify natural processes on one hand, and to compare models with observations on the other. The present analysis focuses on the global carbon cycle as an area of research in which model-data integration and comparisons are key to improving our understanding of natural phenomena. We investigate the dynamics of observed and simulated time series of Gross Primary Productivity (GPP), a key variable in terrestrial ecosystems that quantifies ecosystem carbon uptake. However, the dynamics, patterns and magnitudes of GPP time series, both observed and simulated, vary substantially on different temporal and spatial scales. We demonstrate here that information content and complexity, or Information Theory Quantifiers (ITQ) for short, serve as robust and efficient data-analytical and model benchmarking tools for evaluating the temporal structure and dynamical properties of simulated or observed time series at various spatial scales. At continental scale, we compare GPP time series simulated with two models and an observations-based product. This analysis reveals qualitative differences between model evaluation based on ITQ compared to traditional model performance metrics, indicating that good model performance in terms of absolute or relative error does not imply that the dynamics of the observations is captured well. Furthermore, we show, using an ensemble of site-scale measurements obtained from the FLUXNET archive in the Mediterranean, that model-data or model-model mismatches as indicated by ITQ can be attributed to and interpreted as differences in the temporal structure of the respective ecological time series. At global scale, our understanding of C fluxes relies on the use of consistently applied land models. Here, we use ITQ to evaluate model structure: The measures are largely insensitive to climatic scenarios, land use and atmospheric gas concentrations used to drive them, but clearly separate the structure of 13 different land models taken from the CMIP5 archive and an observations-based product. In conclusion, diagnostic measures of this kind provide data-analytical tools that distinguish different types of natural processes based solely on their dynamics, and are thus highly suitable for environmental science applications such as model structural diagnostics.},

We take an information-theoretic approach to analyzing data from the WAIS Divide ice core, the longest continuous and highest-resolution water isotope record yet recovered from Antarctica. We use weighted permutation entropy to calculate the Shannon entropy rate from these isotope measurements, which are proxies for a number of different climate variables, including the temperature at the time of deposition of the corresponding layer of the core. We find that the rate of information production in these measurements reveals issues with analysis instruments, even when those issues leave no visible traces in the raw data. These entropy calculations also allow us to identify a number of intervals in the data that may be of direct relevance to paleoclimate interpretation, and to form new conjectures about what is happening in those intervals-including periods of abrupt climate change.},

  abstract      = {We have used the Kolmogorov complexities, sample and permutation entropies to quantify the randomness degree in river flow time series of two mountain rivers in Bosnia and Herzegovina, representing the turbulent environmental fluid, for the period 1926-1990. In particular, we have examined the monthly river flow time series from two rivers (the Miljacka and the Bosnia) in the mountain part of their flow and then calculated the Kolmogorov complexity (KL) based on the Lempel-Ziv Algorithm (LZA) (lower-KLL and upper-KLU), sample entropy (SE) and permutation entropy (PE) values for each time series. The results indicate that the KLL, KLU, SE and PE values in two rivers are close to each other regardless of the amplitude differences in their monthly flow rates. We have illustrated the changes in mountain river flow complexity by experiments using (i) the data set for the Bosnia River and (ii) anticipated human activities and projected climate changes. We have explored the sensitivity of considered measures in dependence on the length of time series. In addition, we have divided the period 1926-1990 into three subintervals: (a) 1926-1945, (b) 1946-1965, (c) 1966-1990, and calculated the KLL, KLU, SE, PE values for the various time series in these subintervals. It is found that during the period 1946-1965, there is a decrease in their complexities, and corresponding changes in the SE and PE, in comparison to the period 1926-1990. This complexity loss may be primarily attributed to (i) human interventions, after the Second World War, on these two rivers because of their use for water consumption and (ii) climate change in recent times.

We find that the value of PE is lower in the nonstationary vertical velocity series than the stationary counterparts. Both types of series locate near the region of the higher complexity value in the CECP as chaotic systems, but the PE is smaller and the complexity degree is larger in the nonstationary series than the stationary with smaller time delays. Due to the close relationship between PE and the multiscale Shannon entropy, we show that the PE and CECP can be also taken as an indicator to quantify the different organization degrees of the multiscale structures existing between the stationary and nonstationary surface vertical velocity records.},

For this purpose we build networks from two different reanalysis data sets using both linear and nonlinear statistical similarity measures to determine the existence of links between different regions of the world in the two halves of the last century. We furthermore use symbolic analysis to emphasize intra-seasonal, intra-annual and inter-annual timescales. Both linear and nonlinear networks have similar structures and evolution, showing that the most connected regions are in the tropics over the Pacific Ocean. Also, the Southern Hemisphere extratropics have more connectivity in the first half of the 20th century, particularly on intra-annual and intra-seasonal timescales. Changes over the Pacific main connectivity regions are analyzed in more detail. Both linear and nonlinear networks show that the central and western Pacific regions have decreasing connectivity from early 1900 up to about 1940, when it starts increasing again until the present. The inter-annual network shows a similar behavior. However, this is not true of other timescales. On intra-annual timescales the minimum connectivity is around 1956, with a negative (positive) trend before (after) that date for both the central and western Pacific. While this is also true of the central Pacific on intra-seasonal timescales, the western Pacific shows a positive trend during the entire 20th century. In order to separate the internal and forced connectivity networks and to study their evolution through time, an ensemble of atmospheric general circulation model outputs is used. The results suggest that the main connectivity patterns captured in the reanalysis networks are due to the oceanically forced component, particularly on inter-annual timescales. Moreover, the atmospheric internal variability seems to play an important role in determining the intra-seasonal time-scale networks.},

Despite the large interest that climate networks have attracted, several issues remain to be investigated. Here we focus on the influence of the periodic solar forcing in climate networks constructed via similarities of monthly averaged Surface Air Temperature (SAT) anomalies. We shift the time series in each pair of nodes such as to superpose their seasonal cycles. In this way, when two nodes are located in different hemispheres we are able to quantify the similarity of SAT anomalies during the winters and during the summers. We find that data time-shifting does not significantly modify the network Area Weighted Connectivity (AWC), which is the fraction of the total area of the Earth to which each node is connected. This unexpected network property can be understood in terms of how data time-shifting modifies the strength of the links connecting geographical regions in different hemispheres, and how these modifications are washed out by averaging the AWC.

Climate interdependencies among the nodes are quantified by the mutual information, computed from time series of monthly-averaged surface air temperature anomalies, and from their symbolic ordinal representation (OP). This analysis allows identifying topological changes in the network when varying the time-interval of the ordinal pattern. We consider intra-season time-intervals (e.g., the patterns are formed by anomalies in consecutive months) and inter-annual time-intervals (e.g., the patterns are formed by anomalies in consecutive years). We discuss how the network density and topology change with these time scales, and provide evidence of correlations between geographically distant regions that occur at specific time scales. In particular, we find that an increase in the ordinal pattern spacing (i.e., an increase in the timescale of the ordinal analysis), results in climate networks with increased connectivity on the equatorial Pacific area. On the contrary, the number of significant links decreases when the ordinal analysis is done with a shorter timescale (by comparing consecutive months), and interpret this effect as due to more stochasticity in the time-series in the short timescale. As the equatorial Pacific is known to be dominated by El Nio-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on scales longer than several months, our methodology allows constructing climate networks where the effect of ENSO goes from mild (monthly OP) to intense (yearly OP), independently of the length of the ordinal pattern and of the thresholding method employed.},

  abstract      = {Many physical, biological as well as the environmental problems, can be described by the dynamics of driven coupled oscillators. In order to study their behaviour as a function of coupling strength and nonlinearity, we considered dynamics of two maps serving the combined coupling (diffusive and linear) in the above fields. Firstly, we have considered a logistic difference equation on extended domain that is a part of the maps, that is discussed using its bifurcation diagram, Lyapunov exponent, sample as well as the permutation entropy. Secondly we have performed the dynamical analysis of the coupled maps using Lyapunov exponent and cross sample entropy in dependence on two coupling parameters. Further, we investigated how dynamical noise can affects the structure of their bifurcation diagrams. It was done (i) by the noise entering in two specific ways, that disturbs either the logistic parameter on extended domain or (ii) by an additive "shock" to the state variables. Finally, we demonstrated the effect of forcing by parametric noise, introduced in all maps' parameter, on Lyapunov exponent of coupled maps. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In this article we evaluate the discriminative power of ordinal pattern statistics and symbolic dynamics in comparison with established heart rate variability parameters applied to beat-to-beat intervals. As an illustrative example we distinguish patients suffering from congestive heart failure from a (healthy) control group using beat-to-beat time series. We assess the discriminative power of individual features as well as pairs of features. These comparisons show that ordinal patterns sampled with an additional time lag are promising features for efficient classification. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract      = {Background: High complexity is considered a hallmark of living systems. Here we investigate the complexity of temporal gene expression patterns using the concept of Permutation Entropy (PE) first introduced in dynamical systems theory. The analysis of gene expression data has so far focused primarily on the identification of differentially expressed genes, or on the elucidation of pathway and regulatory relationships. We aim to study gene expression time series data from the viewpoint of complexity. Results: Applying the PE complexity metric to abiotic stress response time series data in Arabidopsis thaliana, genes involved in stress response and signaling were found to be associated with the highest complexity not only under stress, but surprisingly, also under reference, non-stress conditions. Genes with house-keeping functions exhibited lower PE complexity. Compared to reference conditions, the PE of temporal gene expression patterns generally increased upon stress exposure. High-complexity genes were found to have longer upstream intergenic regions and more cis-regulatory motifs in their promoter regions indicative of a more complex regulatory apparatus needed to orchestrate their expression, and to be associated with higher correlation network connectivity degree. Arabidopsis genes also present in other plant species were observed to exhibit decreased PE complexity compared to Arabidopsis specific genes. Conclusions: We show that Permutation Entropy is a simple yet robust and powerful approach to identify temporal gene expression profiles of varying complexity that is equally applicable to other types of molecular profile data.},

  abstract      = {This study explores temporal changes in the dynamics of the Holocene ENSO proxy record of the Laguna Pallcacocha sedimentary data using two entropy quantifiers. In particular, we analyze the possible connections between changes in entropy and epochs of rapid climate change (RCC). Our results indicate that the dynamics of the ENSO proxy record during the RCC interval 9000-8000 BP displays very low entropy (high predictability) that is remarkably different from that of the other RCCs of the Holocene. Both entropy quantifiers point out to the existence of cycles with a period close to 2000 years during the mid-to-late Holocene. Within these cycles, we find a tendency for entropy to increase (predictability to decrease) during the two longer RCC periods (6000-5000 and 3500-2500 BP) which might be associated with the reported increased aridity of the low tropics.
