\chapter{Conclusion}
The main finding of the paper is the analysis of tie-breaking. To ensure stable results, across current implementations of the libraries in the field, it is necessary to both add noise and remove Na values. A new method is proposed that breaks ties evenly among possible patterns. It has the benefit of adding noise because it is a deterministic method, whereas adding noise is a stochastic method. It performed very well for the entropy and should be considered when dealing with a dataset, with a large degree of ties. For the p-values, it was slightly less impressive, since its p-values were not as close to the median of the 10 iterations. It would be interesting to run a larger amount of iterations for adding noise in the p-value section, however, that would require quite a lot of computation power. The last benefit of the implementation is that it runs fast, since only one iteration needs to be run.
