\chapter{Conclusion}
The main findings of the paper is the analysis of tie breaking. To ensure stable results, across current implementations of the libraries in the field, it is necessary to both add noise and remove Na values. A new method is proposed that breaks ties evenly among possible patterns. It has the benefit over adding noise that it is a deterministic method, where adding noise is a stochastic method. For the entropy it performed, very well and should definitely be considered, when dealing with dataset, wit ha large degree of ties. For the p-values, it was slightly less impressive, since its p values were not as close to the median of the 10 iterations. It would be interesting to run a larger amount of iterations for adding noise in the p value section, however, that would require quite a lot of computation power. The last benefit of the implementation is that it runs fast, since only one iteration needs to be run.
