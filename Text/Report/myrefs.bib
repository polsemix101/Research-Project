  abstract   = {In 2002, in a seminal article, Christoph Bandt and Bernd Pompe proposed a new methodology for the analysis of complex time series, now known as Ordinal Analysis. The ordinal methodology is based on the computation of symbols (known as ordinal patterns) which are defined in terms of the temporal ordering of data points in a time series, and whose probabilities are known as ordinal probabilities. With the ordinal probabilities, the Shannon entropy can be calculated, which is the permutation entropy. Since it was proposed, the ordinal method has found applications in fields as diverse as biomedicine and climatology. However, some properties of ordinal probabilities are still not fully understood, and how to combine the ordinal approach of feature extraction with machine learning techniques for model identification, time series classification or forecasting remains a challenge. The objective of this perspective article is to present some recent advances and to discuss some open problems.},

An improvement of some of their troublesome characteristics is thereby achieved. Basically, we replace the Euclidean distance to equilibrium by the Jensen–Shannon divergence.

We apply the “cured” measure to the logistic map so as to clearly exhibit its advantages.},

  abstract  = {The fact is that hundreds of holes are drilled in the assembly process of furniture sets, so intelligent drilling is a key element in maximizing efficiency. Increasing the feed rate or the cutting speed in materials characterized by a higher machinability index is necessary. Smart drilling, that is, the real-time adjustment of the cutting parameters, requires the evolution of cutting process variables. In addition, it is necessary to control and adjust the processing parameters in real time. Machinability is one of the most important technological properties in the machining process, enabling the determination of the material’s susceptibility to machining. One of the machinability indicators is the unit cutting resistance. This article proposes a method of material identification using the short-time Fourier transform in order to automatically adjust cutting parameters during drilling based on force signals, cutting torque and acceleration signals. In the tests, four types of wood-based materials were used as the processed material: medium-density fiberboard, chipboard, plywood board and high-pressure laminate. Holes with a diameter of 10 mm were drilled in the test materials, with variable feed rate, cutting speed and thickness of cutting layer. An innovative method for determining the value of unit cutting resistance was proposed. The results obtained were used to determine the machinability index. Based on the test results, it was shown that both the selected signal measures in the time and frequency domains and the unit cutting resistance are constant for a given material of a workpiece and do not depend on the drilling process parameters. In this article, the methodology is proposed, which can be used as an intelligent technique to support the drilling process to detect the material being machined using data from sensors installed on the machine tool. The work proposes the fundamentals for material identification based on the analysis of force signals and the magnitude of force derivatives. The proposed methodology shows effectiveness, which proves that it can be used in intelligent drilling processes. Hybrid wood-based material structures consisting of different materials are becoming more and more common in building structures for strength, economic and environmental reasons. Due to the difference in the machinability of interconnected materials, cutting parameters must be optimized in real time during machining. Currently, with the rapid development of Industry 4.0, the on-line identification of parameters is becoming necessary to improve the process flow in industrial reality. The proposed methodology can be used as an intelligent technique to support the drilling process in order to detect the material being processed using data from sensors installed on the machine tool.},

We systematically investigated various EEG complexity metrics, including metrics that reflect a system’s regularity like multiscale permutation entropy (MPE), and metrics that reflect a system’s dimensionality like detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA). We also compare these features to traditional band power (BP) features. Data augmentation methods and feature selection were applied to optimize detection accuracy. Results show BP features excelled (mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) 0.646) in datasets without eye-movement artifacts, while MPE showed similar performance (mean AUC 0.639) without requiring removal of eye-movement artifacts. Combining all kinds of features improved decoding performance to 0.66 mean AUC. Our findings demonstrate the potential of these complexity metrics in EEG analysis for mind wandering detection, highlighting their practical implications in educational contexts.},

  abstract = {Abstract           Lucid dreaming (LD) is a state of conscious awareness of the current dream state, predominantly associated with REM sleep. Research progress in uncovering the neurobiological basis of LD has been hindered by low sample sizes, diverse EEG setups, and specific artifact issues like saccadic eye movements and signal non-stationarity. To address these matters, we developed a multi-stage preprocessing pipeline that integrates standardized early-stage preprocessing, artifact subspace reconstruction, and signal-space projection. This approach enhanced data quality by precisely removing saccadic potential effects even in setups with minimal channels. To uncover the electrophysiological correlates of LD, we applied this methodology to LD data collected across laboratories and explored sensor- and source-level markers hypothesized to underlie LD. Compared to non-lucid REM sleep, in line with recent findings we observed few robust differences on the EEG sensor level. In contrast, on the source level, beta power (12-30 Hz) was reduced during LD in right central and parietal areas including the temporo-parietal junction, potentially associated with a conscious reassessment of the veridicality of the currently perceived reality. Gamma1 power (30-36 Hz) around the onset of LD eye signaling increased in right temporo-occipital regions including the right precuneus, in line with its involvement in self-referential thinking. Source-level connectivity analyses revealed alpha (8-12 Hz) mediated communication between anterior frontal and posterior areas, which are usually functionally disconnected during non-lucid REM sleep. Taken together, these findings illuminate the electrophysiological correlates of LD, laying the groundwork for decoding the mechanisms of this intriguing state of consciousness.                        Significance Statement             Lucid dreaming (LD), the state of metacognitive insight into one’s current dream state, has fascinated humans for millennia. Despite decades of neuroscientific inquiry, the brain mechanisms underlying LD remain elusive. Leveraging a newly developed electrophysiological preprocessing pipeline to overcome signal artifacts and harmonize different recording set-ups, this study decoded the spectral nature of LD at the sensor and source levels within a high sample size dataset. Our results point to reductions in temporoparietal beta as well as increased gamma in precuneus in lucid over non-lucid REM sleep. These results enhance our understanding of LD’s mechanisms and ultimately pave the way for targeted induction protocols that will unlock LD’s full clinical potential.},

  abstract  = {This paper presents a chaotic system based on novel semiconductor nanolasers (NLs), systematically analyzing its chaotic region and investigating the influence of key parameters on the unpredictability of chaotic output. This study found that under optical feedback conditions, NLs generate chaos across a wide range of feedback parameters, with the highly unpredictable region completely overlapping with the chaotic region. Further injection into the slave lasers enhances the chaotic output, expanding the range of unpredictability. Additionally, we analyzed the impact of internal parameter mismatch on the complexity of chaotic signals and found it to be similar to the scenario when parameters are matched. Using this chaotic system as an entropy source, we constructed a random number generator (RNG) and investigated the effects of internal parameters mismatch and differences in the injection parameters on the generator’s performance. The simulation results show that the RNG performs well under different parameter settings, and the generated random sequences pass all random number tests successfully. Therefore, this chaotic system can yield a high-complexity chaotic light source with appropriate parameter selection, and when combined with effective post-processing, it can generate high-quality random numbers. This is crucial for advancing the realization of small-sized, high-randomness RNGs.},

More than 250 articles on COVID-19 published in Frontiers in Public Health have contributed to these insights. We discuss here some of the key research themes and challenges that have been addressed. We provide our perspective on current research issues with surveillance data quality and limitations of epidemiological methods. We warn against the potential misuse or misleading interpretation of public data of variable quality and the use of inadequate study designs for the evaluation of effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions. We conclude by interrogating possible public health strategies for pandemic control as well as discuss the ethical responsibilities and democratic accountability of researchers in their role as experts and policy advisors.},

  abstract      = {Turbulent magnetic field fluctuations in the solar wind have been extensively investigated, but few studies have analyzed their complexity. Jensen-Shannon complexity maps of time series data provide a mathematical tool that can characterize fluctuations in laboratory experiments as stochastic, chaotic, or periodic phenomena. We apply this recently developed tool to characterize stochastic behavior in solar wind structures, including interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs), co-rotating interactions regions (CIRs), and turbulent magnetic fluctuation intervals. We find that the turbulent intervals observed by Helios, Wind, and Ulysses lie within the stochastic region of the complexity maps and that their complexity decreases while their normalized entropy increases with distance from the Sun. The complexity values associated with the fast solar wind ({\textgreater}550 km s(-1)) turbulence identified in Ulysses data beyond 5 au are highest at low latitudes ({\textless}10 degrees) and lowest at latitudes above 20 degrees. The Jensen-Shannon complexity maps show that fluctuations in the magnetic field, plasma flow, and density of the solar wind at 1 au are stochastic in ICMEs and CIRs identified in Wind data. Our analysis of Ulysses data between 1.4 and 5.4 au shows that the complexity of the ICMEs decreases with distance from the Sun, and the normalized entropy increases. Furthermore, the complexity values associated with magnetic field fluctuations in ICMEs identified in Ulysses data behave like the slow solar wind turbulence fluctuations within 4 au and take on values closer to the complexity values of the fast solar wind beyond 4 au.},

Our results indicate that the dynamics of the ENSO proxy record during the RCC interval 9000-8000 BP displays very low entropy (high predictability) that is remarkably different from that of the other RCCs of the Holocene. Both entropy quantifiers point out to the existence of cycles with a period close to 2000 years during the mid-to-late Holocene. Within these cycles, we find a tendency for entropy to increase (predictability to decrease) during the two longer RCC periods (6000-5000 and 3500-2500 BP) which might be associated with the reported increased aridity of the low tropics.

  abstract = {Ordinal patterns serve as a robust symbolic transformation technique, enabling the unveiling of latent dynamics within time series data. This methodology involves constructing histograms of patterns, followed by the calculation of both entropy and statistical complexity—an avenue yet to be fully understood in terms of its statistical properties. While asymptotic results can be derived by assuming a multinomial distribution for histogram proportions, the challenge emerges from the non-independence present in the sequence of ordinal patterns. Consequently, the direct application of the multinomial assumption is questionable. This study focuses on the computation of the asymptotic distribution of permutation entropy, considering the inherent patterns’ correlation structure. Furthermore, the research delves into a comparative analysis, pitting this distribution against the entropy derived from a multinomial law. We present simulation algorithms for sampling time series with prescribed histograms of patterns and transition probabilities between them. Through this analysis, we better understand the intricacies of ordinal patterns and their statistical attributes.},

In particular, knowing the joint distribution of the pair entropy-statistical complexity for a large class of time series models would allow statistical tests that are unavailable to date. Working in this direction, we characterize the asymptotic distribution of the empirical Shannon’s entropy for any model under which the true normalized entropy is neither zero nor one. We obtain the asymptotic distribution from the central limit theorem (assuming large time series), the multivariate delta method, and a third-order correction of its mean value. We discuss the applicability of other results (exact, first-, and second-order corrections) regarding their accuracy and numerical stability. Within a general framework for building test statistics about Shannon’s entropy, we present a bilateral test that verifies if there is enough evidence to reject the hypothesis that two signals produce ordinal patterns with the same Shannon’s entropy. We applied this bilateral test to the daily maximum temperature time series from three cities (Dublin, Edinburgh, and Miami) and obtained sensible results.},

  abstract      = {This study explores temporal changes in the dynamics of the Holocene ENSO proxy record of the Laguna Pallcacocha sedimentary data using two entropy quantifiers. In particular, we analyze the possible connections between changes in entropy and epochs of rapid climate change (RCC). Our results indicate that the dynamics of the ENSO proxy record during the RCC interval 9000-8000 BP displays very low entropy (high predictability) that is remarkably different from that of the other RCCs of the Holocene. Both entropy quantifiers point out to the existence of cycles with a period close to 2000 years during the mid-to-late Holocene. Within these cycles, we find a tendency for entropy to increase (predictability to decrease) during the two longer RCC periods (6000-5000 and 3500-2500 BP) which might be associated with the reported increased aridity of the low tropics.
