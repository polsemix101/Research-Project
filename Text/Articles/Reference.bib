  abstract      = {Inferring the dependence structure of complex networks from the observation of the non-linear dynamics of its components is among the common, yet far from resolved challenges faced when studying real-world complex systems. While a range of methods using the ordinal patterns framework has been proposed to particularly tackle the problem of dependence inference in the presence of non-linearity, they come with important restrictions in the scope of their application. Hereby, we introduce the sign patterns as an extension of the ordinal patterns, arising from a more flexible symbolization which is able to encode longer sequences with lower number of symbols. After transforming time series into sequences of sign patterns, we derive improved estimates for statistical quantities by considering necessary constraints on the probabilities of occurrence of combinations of symbols in a symbolic process with prohibited transitions. We utilize these to design an asymptotic chi-squared test to evaluate dependence between two time series and then apply it to the construction of climate networks, illustrating that the developed method can capture both linear and non-linear dependences, while avoiding bias present in the naive application of the often used Pearson correlation coefficient or mutual information.},

  abstract      = {Learning from successful applications of methods originating in statistical mechanics, complex systems science, or information theory in one scientific field (e.g., atmospheric physics or climatology) can provide important insights or conceptual ideas for other areas (e.g., space sciences) or even stimulate new research questions and approaches. For instance, quantification and attribution of dynamical complexity in output time series of nonlinear dynamical systems is a key challenge across scientific disciplines. Especially in the field of space physics, an early and accurate detection of characteristic dissimilarity between normal and abnormal states (e.g., pre-storm activity vs. magnetic storms) has the potential to vastly improve space weather diagnosis and, consequently, the mitigation of space weather hazards.This review provides a systematic overview on existing nonlinear dynamical systems-based methodologies along with key results of their previous applications in a space physics context, which particularly illustrates how complementary modern complex systems approaches have recently shaped our understanding of nonlinear magnetospheric variability. The rising number of corresponding studies demonstrates that the multiplicity of nonlinear time series analysis methods developed during the last decades offers great potentials for uncovering relevant yet complex processes interlinking different geospace subsystems, variables and spatiotemporal scales.},

In addition, we use two network indices, which are the global subnetwork mutual information ( I) and the global subnetwork clustering coefficient ( C), to quantitatively measure the spatial coupling strength of different gas-liquid flow patterns. The gas-liquid two-phase flow pattern evolutionary behaviors are further characterized by calculating the two proposed coupling indices under different flow conditions. The proposed interconnected ordinal pattern network provides a novel tool for a deeper understanding of the evolutional mechanisms of the multi-phase flow system, and it can also be used to investigate the coupling behaviors of other complex systems with multiple observations.},

  abstract      = {The recovery of long-term climate proxy records with seasonal resolution is rare because of natural smoothing processes, discontinuities and limitations in measurement resolution. Yet insolation forcing, a primary driver of multimillennial-scale climate change, acts through seasonal variations with direct impacts on seasonal climate(1). Whether the sensitivity of seasonal climate to insolation matches theoretical predictions has not been assessed over long timescales. Here, we analyse a continuous record of water-isotope ratios from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet Divide ice core to reveal summer and winter temperature changes through the last 11,000 years. Summer temperatures in West Antarctica increased through the early-to-mid-Holocene, reached a peak 4,100 years ago and then decreased to the present. Climate model simulations show that these variations primarily reflect changes in maximum summer insolation, confirming the general connection between seasonal insolation and warming and demonstrating the importance of insolation intensity rather than seasonally integrated insolation or season duration(2,3). Winter temperatures varied less overall, consistent with predictions from insolation forcing, but also fluctuated in the early Holocene, probably owing to changes in meridional heat transport. The magnitudes of summer and winter temperature changes constrain the lowering of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet surface since the early Holocene to less than 162 m and probably less than 58 m, consistent with geological constraints elsewhere in West Antarctica(4-7).},

First, on the basis of a statistical linguistics procedure, the m-th order differences of the monthly mean precipitations and temperatures on the globe are symbolized according to a binary coding rule. Subsequently, the annual 12-bit binary sequence for a station is divided into twelve 6-bit sequences by scanning it over a year. Computed results indicate that there is an optimal order of differences with which one can reveal the variabilities most distinctly. Specifically, it is found that for the analysis of precipitations, the second differences (m = 2) are most useful, whereas, for the temperatures, the third differences (m = 3) are preferable. A detailed comparison between the information-theoretic and the ranking methods suggests that along with the stability and coherence, owing to its ability to make an appeal to the eyes, the latter is superior to the former.},

  abstract      = {Context. Sheath regions ahead of interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) are compressed and turbulent global heliospheric structures. Their global and fine-scale structure are outstanding research problems, and only a few studies have been conducted on this topic closer to the Sun than 1 au. Comprehensive knowledge of the sheath structure and embedded fluctuations and of their evolution in interplanetary space is important for understanding their geoeffectiveness, their role in accelerating charged particles to high energies, the interaction of ICMEs with the ambient wind, and the transport of energy between boundaries. Aims. Our key aims are to investigate in detail the overall structure, as well as nature (stochastic, chaotic, or periodic) and origin, of magnetic fluctuations within a sheath ahead of a slow ICME in the inner heliosphere. Methods. We used magnetic field and plasma observations from the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) during a sheath region observed at similar to 0.5 au on March 15, 2019, ahead of a slow and slowly expanding streamer blow-out CME bracketed between a slower and faster stream. To examine the magnetohydrodynamic-scale turbulent properties, we present an analysis of the fluctuation amplitudes, magnetic compressibility of fluctuations, partial variance of increments (PVI), normalised cross helicity (sigma(c)), and normalised residual energy (sigma(r)). We also conducted a Jensen-Shannon permutation entropy and complexity analysis. Results. The investigated sheath consisted of slower and faster flows that were separated by a brief (similar to 15 min) change in the magnetic sector bounded by current sheet crossings and a velocity shear zone. The fluctuation amplitudes and frequency of high PVI values were larger and higher throughout the sheath than in the upstream wind and had dominantly negative sigma(r) and strongly positive sigma(c). The velocity shear region marked a strong increase in temperature and specific entropy, and the following faster flow had large local patches of positive sigma(r) as well as larger fluctuation amplitudes and higher PVI values, in particular at smaller timescales. Fluctuations in the preceding wind and in the sheath were found to be stochastic. However, sheath fluctuations showed lower entropy and higher complexity, with entropy showing a reducing and complexity an increasing trend with increasing time lag. Conclusions. The two-part sheath structure was likely a result of a warp in the heliospheric current sheet (HCS) that was swept up and compressed into the sheath. The driving ejecta accelerated and heated the wind at the back of the sheath, which then interacted with the slower wind ahead of the HCS warp. This also caused some distinct differences in fluctuation properties across the sheath. Sheaths of slow ICMEs originating as streamer blow-outs can thus have complex structure where fluctuation properties are not just downstream shock properties, but are generated within the sheath. At short timescales, fluctuations feature fully developed and imbalanced MHD turbulence, while at longer scales, fluctuations are increasingly dominated by intermittent coherent and ordered structures.},

However, due to the comprehensive influence of climatic conditions, geographical environment, and human activities, the runoff series is nonlinear and non-stationary, and there are still great challenges in mid-long term runoff forecasting. In order to improve the prediction accuracy, a novel model TVF-EMD-PE-PSO-GRU (TEPPG) was proposed in this study. Firstly, several intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) were obtained by decomposing the original runoff series by time-varying filter-based empirical mode decomposition (TVF-EMD). Secondly, the permutation entropy (PE) algorithm was used to calculate the complexity of each IMF, and the IMF with similar complexity was combined. Then, the gated recurrent unit (GRU) model based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) was used to predict each IMF after merging. Finally, the prediction results of each IMF were superimposed to obtain the final results. And compared with three models such as TVF-EMD-PSO-GRU, extreme-point symmetric mode decomposition coupled gated recurrent unit and particle swarm optimization (ESMD-PSO-GRU), complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise coupled gated recurrent unit, and particle swarm optimization (CEEMDAN-PSO-GRU). The monthly and annual runoff forecasting of Tangnaihai hydrological station in the upper reaches of the Yellow River and Cuntan hydrological station in the upstream of the Yangtze River was taken as examples to test the performance of the model. The results show that, compared with the other three models, the TEPPG model had the highest prediction accuracy and was relatively stable in both monthly and annual runoff forecasts. Thus, the proposed method was developed to support the decision-making of water resource system.},

Despite its importance, direct tests of chaos vs stochasticity in finite time series still lack of a definitive quantification. Here we present a novel approach based on recurrence analysis, a nonlinear approach to deal with data. The main idea is the identification of how recurrence microstates and permutation patterns are affected by time reversibility of data, and how its behavior can be used to distinguish stochastic and deterministic data. We demonstrate the efficiency of the method for a bunch of paradigmatic systems under strong noise influence, as well as for real-world data, covering electronic circuit, sound vocalization and human speeches, neuronal activity, heart beat data, and geomagnetic indexes. Our results support the conclusion that the method distinguishes well deterministic from stochastic fluctuations in simulated and empirical data even under strong noise corruption, finding applications involving various areas of science and technology. In particular, for deterministic signals, the quantification of chaotic behavior may be of fundamental importance because it is believed that chaotic properties of some systems play important functional roles, opening doors to a better understanding and/or control of the physical mechanisms behind the generation of the signals.},

  abstract      = {Identifying and characterising dynamical regime shifts, critical transitions or potential tipping points in palaeoclimate time series is relevant for improving the understanding of often highly nonlinear Earth system dynamics. Beyond linear changes in time series properties such as mean, variance, or trend, these nonlinear regime shifts can manifest as changes in signal predictability, regularity, complexity, or higher-order stochastic properties such as multi-stability. In recent years, several classes of methods have been put forward to study these critical transitions in time series data that are based on concepts from nonlinear dynamics, complex systems science, information theory, and stochastic analysis. These include approaches such as phase space-based recurrence plots and recurrence networks, visibility graphs, order pattern-based entropies, and stochastic modelling. Here, we review and compare in detail several prominent methods from these fields by applying them to the same set of marine palaeoclimate proxy records of African climate variations during the past 5 million years. Applying these methods, we observe notable nonlinear transitions in palaeoclimate dynamics in these marine proxy records and discuss them in the context of important climate events and regimes such as phases of intensified Walker circulation, marine isotope stage M2, the onset of northern hemisphere glaciation and the mid-Pleistocene transition. We find that the studied approaches complement each other by allowing us to point out distinct aspects of dynamical regime shifts in palaeoclimate time series. We also detect significant correlations of these nonlinear regime shift indicators with variations of Earth's orbit, suggesting the latter as potential triggers of nonlinear transitions in palaeoclimate. Overall, the presented study underlines the potentials of nonlinear time series analysis approaches to provide complementary information on dynamical regime shifts in palaeoclimate and their driving processes that cannot be revealed by linear statistics or eyeball inspection of the data alone.

  abstract      = {Identifying causal relationships is a challenging yet crucial problem in many fields of science like epidemiology, climatology, ecology, genomics, economics and neuroscience, to mention only a few. Recent studies have demonstrated that ordinal partition transition networks (OPTNs) allow inferring the coupling direction between two dynamical systems. In this work, we generalize this concept to the study of the interactions among multiple dynamical systems and we propose a new method to detect causality in multivariate observational data. By applying this method to numerical simulations of coupled linear stochastic processes as well as two examples of interacting nonlinear dynamical systems (coupled Lorenz systems and a network of neural mass models), we demonstrate that our approach can reliably identify the direction of interactions and the associated coupling delays. Finally, we study real-world observational microelectrode array electrophysiology data from rodent brain slices to identify the causal coupling structures underlying epileptiform activity. Our results, both from simulations and real-world data, suggest that OPTNs can provide a complementary and robust approach to infer causal effect networks from multivariate observational data.},

  abstract      = {Global warming is posed to modify the modes of variability that control much of the climate predictability at seasonal to interannual scales. The quantification of changes in climate predictability over any given amount of time, however, remains challenging. Here we build upon recent advances in non-linear dynamical systems theory and introduce the climate community to an information entropy quantifier based on recurrence. The entropy, or complexity of a system is associated with microstates that recur over time in the time-series that define the system, and therefore to its predictability potential. A computationally fast method to evaluate the entropy is applied to the investigation of the information entropy of sea surface temperature in the tropical Pacific and Indian Oceans, focusing on boreal fall. In this season the predictability of the basins is controlled by two regularly varying non-linear oscillations, the El Nino-Southern Oscillation and the Indian Ocean Dipole. We compute and compare the entropy in simulations from the CMIP5 catalog from the historical period and RCP8.5 scenario, and in reanalysis datasets. Discrepancies are found between the models and the reanalysis, and no robust changes in predictability can be identified in future projections. The Indian Ocean and the equatorial Pacific emerge as troublesome areas where the modeled entropy differs the most from that of the reanalysis in many models. A brief investigation of the source of the bias points to a poor representation of the ocean mean state and basins' connectivity at the Indonesian Throughflow.},

The theoretical foundation for the popular early warning signal approach has been limited to relatively simple system changes such as bifurcating fixed points where variability is extrinsic to the steady state. We offer a novel measurement of stability that applies in wide ranging systems that contain variability in both internal steady state dynamics and in response to external perturbations. Utilizing connections between stability, dissipation, and phase space flow, we show that stability correlates with temporal asymmetry in a measure of phase space flow contraction. Our method is general as it reveals stability variation independent of assumptions about the nature of system variability or attractor shape. After showing efficacy in a variety of model systems, we apply our technique for measuring stability to monthly returns of the S\&P 500 index in the time periods surrounding the global stock market crash of October 1987. Market stability is shown to be higher in the several years preceding and subsequent to the 1987 market crash. We anticipate our technique will have wide applicability in climate, ecological, financial, and social systems where stability is a pressing concern.},

More specifically, we generalize a traditional statistical complexity measure (SCM) based on permutation entropy by explicitly disclosing heterogeneous frequencies of ordinal pattern transitions. To demonstrate the usefulness of these generalized SCMs, we employ them to characterize different dynamical transitions in the logistic map as a paradigmatic model system, as well as real-world time series of fluid experiments and electrocardiogram recordings. The obtained results for both artificial and experimental data demonstrate that the consideration of transition frequencies between different ordinal patterns leads to dynamically meaningful estimates of SCMs, which provide prospective tools for the analysis of observational time series.},

Accurate prediction of annual sediment concentration in the lower Yellow River can provide a theoretical basis for flood control and disaster reduction and rational utilization of water and soil resources in the lower Yellow River. For the defects of pseudo-components in data decomposition of Complementary EEMD, the Modified EEMD (MEEMD) method proposed in this paper has the advantage of eliminating pseudo components of IMF and reducing non-stationarity of sediment bearing sequences. Then, combined with the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model with strong approximation ability to the stationary sequence, the MEEMD-ARIMA model for predicting the annual sediment concentration in the lower Yellow River was constructed. Through fitting and predicting the annual sediment concentration in Gaocun Station, it is shown that the model not only considers the evolution of sediment concentration in various frequency domains, but also solves the problem that the ARIMA model requires sequence to be stable, the relative error of prediction is within +/- 6\%, and the prediction accuracy is high, thus providing a new method for the prediction of sediment concentration.},

The chorusing pattern explored in this long-term study provides important baseline data to understand the impact of climate change and of climate-driven extreme/episodic events on the phenology of fishes; this work also provides evidence that changes in the ambient conditions might significantly alter the phenology of vocalizing marine species.},

This study aims to measure streamflow complexity in the headwater areas of the TP and investigate the coupling effects of climatic variables (i.e., precipitation and air temperature) on the streamflow complexity across multiple timescales. Using daily streamflow records, we employ permutation entropy as the measure of annual streamflow complexity in the upper Heihe River (UHR) watershed in the northeastern TP from 1960 to 2014. Additionally, wavelet coherence is applied to evaluate the impact of climate (i.e., precipitation and temperature) change. Our results show: (1) due to climate change, streamflow complexity has significantly increased since 1972 in the UHR watershed; (2) the periods of warmer and wetter weather have a longer-term influence on streamflow complexity. Specifically, before 1972, dryer, colder weather in the TP would significantly affect the complexity of the streamflow every three to four years, but after that date, these climatic events occurred less frequently, with gaps of between eight and twelve years, during which the weather was much warmer and wetter; and (3) the influence of precipitation on the streamflow complexity decreased, while that of air temperature increased. Therefore, the impact of climate change on streamflow complexity relating to the dynamic structure of streamflow should be regarded as significant to the work of hydrologists and water resource management agencies.},

Characterizing the recent extreme drought events and uncovering the influence from the surrounding oceans remain to be big challenges. The physical mechanisms of extreme drought events in the NEB are due to varying interacting time scales from the surrounding tropical oceans (Pacific and Atlantic). From time series observations, we propose a three-step strategy to establish the episodic coupling directions on intraseasonal time scales from the ocean to the precipitation patterns in the NEB, focusing on the distinctive roles of the oceans during the recent extreme drought events of 2012-2013 and 2015-2016. Our algorithm involves the following: (i) computing drought period length from daily precipitation anomalies to capture extreme drought events; (ii) characterizing the episodic coupling delays from the surrounding oceans to the precipitation by applying the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) of complexity measure, which is based on ordinal partition transition network representation of time series; and (iii) calculating the ratio of high temperature in the ocean during the extreme drought events with proper time lags that are identified by KLD measures. From the viewpoint of climatology, our analysis provides data-based evidence of showing significant influence from the North Atlantic in 2012-2013 to the NEB, but in 2015-2016, the Pacific played a dominant role than that of the Atlantic. The episodic intraseasonal time scale properties are potential for monitoring and forecasting droughts in the NEB in order to propose strategies for drought impacts reduction.},

Here we show for the first time that max(S) can be used as a parameter-free quantifier of short and long-term memories (time-correlations) of stochastic and chaotic signals. max(S) can also evaluate properties of the distribution function of the data set that are not related to time correlation. To illustrate this fact, we show that even shuffled versions of distinct time correlated stochastic signals lead to different, but coherently varying, values of max(S). Such a property of max(S) is associated to its ability to quantify in how many ways distinct short recurrence sequences can be found in time series. Applied to a deterministic dissipative system, the method brings evidence about the attractor properties and the degree of chaoticity. We conclude that the development of a new parameter-free quantifier of stochastic and chaotic time series can open new perspectives to stochastic data and deterministic time series analyses and may find applications in many areas of science.

  abstract      = {Intrinsic predictability is imperative to quantify inherent information contained in a time series and assists in evaluating the performance of different forecasting methods to get the best possible prediction. Model forecasting performance is the measure of the probability of success. Nevertheless, model performance or the model does not provide understanding for improvement in prediction. Intuitively, intrinsic predictability delivers the highest level of predictability for a time series and informative in unfolding whether the system is unpredictable or the chosen model is a poor choice. We introduce a novel measure, the Wavelet Entropy Energy Measure (WEEM), based on wavelet transformation and information entropy for quantification of intrinsic predictability of time series. To investigate the efficiency and reliability of the proposed measure, model forecast performance was evaluated via a wavelet networks approach. The proposed measure uses the wavelet energy distribution of a time series at different scales and compares it with the wavelet energy distribution of white noise to quantify a time series as deterministic or random. We test the WEEM using a wide variety of time series ranging from deterministic, non-stationary, and ones contaminated with white noise with different noise-signal ratios. Furthermore, a relationship is developed between the WEEM and Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency, one of the widely known measures of forecast performance. The reliability of WEEM is demonstrated by exploring the relationship to logistic map and real-world data.},

  abstract      = {Understanding the structuration of spatio-temporal information is a common endeavour to many disciplines and application domains, e.g., geography, ecology, urban planning, epidemiology. Revealing the processes involved, in relation to one or more phenomena, is often the first step before elaborating spatial functioning theories and specific planning actions, e.g., epidemiological modelling, urban planning. To do so, the spatio-temporal distributions of meaningful variables from a decision-making viewpoint, can be explored, analysed separately or jointly from an information viewpoint. Using metrics based on the measure of entropy has a long practice in these domains with the aim of quantification of how uniform the distributions are. However, the level of embedding of the spatio-temporal dimension in the metrics used is often minimal. This paper borrows from the landscape ecology concept of patch size distribution and the approach of permutation entropy used in biomedical signal processing to derive a spatio-temporal entropy analysis framework for categorical variables. The framework is based on a spatio-temporal structuration of the information allowing to use a decomposition of the Shannon entropy which can also embrace some existing spatial or temporal entropy indices to reinforce the spatio-temporal structuration. Multiway correspondence analysis is coupled to the decomposition entropy to propose further decomposition and entropy quantification of the spatio-temporal structuring information. The flexibility from these different choices, including geographic scales, allows for a range of domains to take into account domain specifics of the data; some of which are explored on a dataset linked to climate change and evolution of land cover types in Nordic areas.},

The analysis of its spatial and temporal variation is of great significance to evaluate prediction uncertainty of the regional temperature trends and the climate change. In this study, annual-TFC from 1979-2017 and seasonal-TFC from 1983-2017 in China were calculated by permutation entropy (PE). Their temporal trend is described by the Mann-Kendall method. Driving factors of their spatial variations are explored through GeoDetector. The results show that: (1). TFC shows a downward trend generally, with obvious time variation. (2). The spatial variation of TFC is mainly manifested in the differences among the five sub-regions in China. There is low uncertainty in the short-term temperature trends in the northwest and southeast. The northeastern and southwestern regions show high uncertainties. TFC in the central region is moderate. (3). The vegetation is the main factor of spatial variation, followed by the climate and altitude, and the latitude and terrain display the lowest impact. The interactions of vegetation-altitude, vegetation-climate and altitude-latitude can interpret more than 50\% of the spatial variations. These results provide insights into causes and mechanisms of the complexity of the climate system. They can help to determine the influencing process of various factors.},

In order to reach this goal, insight from analyzing predictability of series with known structure information is necessary. Time series generated by theoretical models with four kinds of known predictive structures, i.e., short-term correlation, long-term correlation, and multifractal and chaotic patterns, are applied to demonstrate that there is a well-defined relation between series' intrinsic predictability and prediction accuracy of any specific prediction model. And results show that both intrinsic predictability and prediction accuracy are enhanced by these well-defined structures. There are different regimes in the relation between intrinsic predictability and prediction accuracy for series with different known deterministic or stochastic predictive structures. These regimes in the relation between intrinsic predictability and prediction accuracy can guide us to preselect a suitable prediction model and forecast strategies for any underlying series by only analyzing the permutation entropy of a given series. Results from three pieces of climate series further confirm that insights from theoretical series with known structure information indeed work well.},

The intrinsic predictability tells us whether there are more predictive structures in DTR fluctuations and to what extent the maximal predictability can be reached. The realizable predictability measures the degree of prediction to which adopted model reaches. Results show that there is a well defined regime-dependent pattern between the intrinsic predictability and the realizable predictability in DTR fluctuations, and both the intrinsic predictability and the realizable predictability in DTR fluctuations over China are overall South-North (with the dividing line around the latitude of 37 degrees N and almost along the Yellow River, and south and north to this line are called southern China and northern China in this study) asymmetric with higher predictability in southern China and weaker predictability in northern China.

In this work, we introduce a suite of OPTN based complexity measures to infer the coupling direction between two dynamical systems from pairs of time series. For several examples of coupled stochastic processes, we demonstrate that our approach is able to successfully identify interaction delays of both unidirectional and bidirectional coupling configurations. Moreover, we show that the causal interaction between two coupled chaotic Henon maps can be captured by the OPTN based complexity measures for a broad range of coupling strengths before the onset of synchronization. Finally, we apply our method to two real-world observational climate time series, disclosing the interaction delays underlying the temperature records from two distinct stations in Oxford and Vienna. Our results suggest that ordinal partition transition networks can be used as complementary tools for causal inference tasks and provide insights into the potentials and theoretical foundations of time series networks.

  abstract      = {Turbulent magnetic field fluctuations in the solar wind have been extensively investigated, but few studies have analyzed their complexity. Jensen-Shannon complexity maps of time series data provide a mathematical tool that can characterize fluctuations in laboratory experiments as stochastic, chaotic, or periodic phenomena. We apply this recently developed tool to characterize stochastic behavior in solar wind structures, including interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs), co-rotating interactions regions (CIRs), and turbulent magnetic fluctuation intervals. We find that the turbulent intervals observed by Helios, Wind, and Ulysses lie within the stochastic region of the complexity maps and that their complexity decreases while their normalized entropy increases with distance from the Sun. The complexity values associated with the fast solar wind ({\textgreater}550 km s(-1)) turbulence identified in Ulysses data beyond 5 au are highest at low latitudes ({\textless}10 degrees) and lowest at latitudes above 20 degrees. The Jensen-Shannon complexity maps show that fluctuations in the magnetic field, plasma flow, and density of the solar wind at 1 au are stochastic in ICMEs and CIRs identified in Wind data. Our analysis of Ulysses data between 1.4 and 5.4 au shows that the complexity of the ICMEs decreases with distance from the Sun, and the normalized entropy increases. Furthermore, the complexity values associated with magnetic field fluctuations in ICMEs identified in Ulysses data behave like the slow solar wind turbulence fluctuations within 4 au and take on values closer to the complexity values of the fast solar wind beyond 4 au.},

  abstract      = {The analysis of the effects of human activities and climate variability on the structural characteristics of streamflow series facilitates further exploring the regularity of streamflow change and revealing the process of hydrological cycle response. The principal goal of this study is to establish an analysis system to diagnose the change in structural characteristics of streamflow series via employing suitable complexity measurement methods for specific cases. Meanwhile, an application scope table has been built based on testing and comparing the logicality and antinoise robustness through using logistic mapping series, random series, white noise, and 1/f noise for five commonly used complexity measurement methods (approximate entropy, permutation entropy, sample entropy, fractal, and Lempel-Ziv). According to the application scope table, sample entropy is the most suitable method for this specific case. Moreover, the results illustrate that in the prechange period, the complexity of the streamflow series is 0.5176; in the postchange period, the complexity value is 0.3722 if the streamflow is only impacted by climate variability; and its value is 0.2571 if it is impacted by both human activities and climate variability. Climate variability reduces the complexity of streamflow series, and human activities intensify this reduction. A decrease of complexity indicates that the streamflow series becomes more stable and regular.},

  abstract      = {In the last decade, there has been a growing body of literature addressing the utilization of complex network methods for the characterization of dynamical systems based on time series. While both nonlinear time series analysis and complex network theory are widely considered to be established fields of complex systems sciences with strong links to nonlinear dynamics and statistical physics, the thorough combination of both approaches has become an active field of nonlinear time series analysis, which has allowed addressing fundamental questions regarding the structural organization of nonlinear dynamics as well as the successful treatment of a variety of applications from a broad range of disciplines. In this report, we provide an in-depth review of existing approaches of time series networks, covering their methodological foundations, interpretation and practical considerations with an emphasis on recent developments. After a brief outline of the state-of-the-art of nonlinear time series analysis and the theory of complex networks, we focus on three main network approaches, namely, phase space based recurrence networks, visibility graphs and Markov chain based transition networks, all of which have made their way from abstract concepts to widely used methodologies. These three concepts, as well as several variants thereof will be discussed in great detail regarding their specific properties, potentials and limitations. More importantly, we emphasize which fundamental new insights complex network approaches bring into the field of nonlinear time series analysis. In addition, we summarize examples from the wide range of recent applications of these methods, covering rather diverse fields like climatology, fluid dynamics, neurophysiology, engineering and economics, and demonstrating the great potentials of time series networks for tackling real-world contemporary scientific problems. The overall aim of this report is to provide the readers with the knowledge how the complex network approaches can be applied to their own field of real-world time series analysis.

The new methodology to compute the entropy of a time series has advantages compared to the traditional entropies defined in the literature, namely, a good correlation with the maximum Lyapunov exponent of the system and a weak dependence on the vicinity threshold parameter. Furthermore, the new method works adequately even for small segments of data, bringing consistent results for short and long time series. In a case where long time series are available, the new methodology can be employed to obtain high precision results since it does not demand large computational times related to the analysis of the entire time series or recurrence matrices, as is the case of other traditional entropy quantifiers. The method is applied to discrete and continuous systems. Published by AIP Publishing.},

  abstract      = {Ramp-like structures in various atmospheric surface layer time series have been long studied, but the presence of motifs with the finer scale embedded within larger scale ramp-like structures has largely been overlooked in the reported literature. Here a novel, objective and well-adapted methodology, the ordinal pattern analysis, is adopted to study the finer-scaled motifs in atmospheric boundary-layer (ABL) time series. The studies show that the motifs represented by different ordinal patterns take clustering properties and 6 dominated motifs out of the whole 24 motifs account for about 45\% of the time series under particular scales, which indicates the higher contribution of motifs with the finer scale to the series. Further studies indicate that motif statistics are similar for both stable conditions and unstable conditions at larger scales, but large discrepancies are found at smaller scales, and the frequencies of motifs "1234" and/or "4321" are a bit higher under stable conditions than unstable conditions. Under stable conditions, there are great changes for the occurrence frequencies of motifs "1234" and "4321", where the occurrence frequencies of motif "1234" decrease from nearly 24\% to 4.5\% with the scale factor increasing, and the occurrence frequencies of motif "4321" change nonlinearly with the scale increasing. These great differences of dominated motifs change with scale can be taken as an indicator to quantify the flow structure changes under different stability conditions, and motif entropy can be defined just by only 6 dominated motifs to quantify this time-scale independent property of the motifs. All these results suggest that the defined scale of motifs with the finer scale should be carefully taken into consideration in the interpretation of turbulence coherent structures.

  abstract      = {Evolution of influenza viruses is a highly complex process that is still poorly understood. Multiyear persistence of similar variants and accumulating evidences of existence of multigenic traits indicates that influenza viruses operate as integrated units and not only as sets of distinct genes. However, there is still no consensus on whether it is the case, and to what extent. One of the main problems is the lack of framework for analyzing and interpreting large body of available high dimensional genomic, clinical and epidemiological data. By reducing dimensionality of data we intend to show whether in addition to gene-centric selective pressure, the evolution of influenza RNA segments is also shaped by their mutual interactions. Therefore, we will analyze how different complexity/entropy measures (Shannon entropy, topological entropy and Lempel-Ziv complexity) can be used to study evolution of nucleotide segments of different influenza subtypes, while reducing data dimensionality. We show that, at the nucleotide level, multiyear clusters of genome-wide entropy/complexity correlations emerged during the H1N1 pandemic in 2009. Our data are the first empirical results that indirectly support the suggestion that a component of influenza evolutionary dynamics involves correlation between RNA segments. Of all used complexity/entropy measures, Shannon entropy shows the best correlation with epidemiological data.},

  abstract      = {Finding the correct encoding for a generic dynamical system's trajectory is a complicated task: the symbolic sequence needs to preserve the invariant properties from the system's trajectory. In theory, the solution to this problem is found when a Generating Markov Partition (GMP) is obtained, which is only defined once the unstable and stable manifolds are known with infinite precision and for all times. However, these manifolds usually form highly convoluted Euclidean sets, are a priori unknown, and, as it happens in any real-world experiment, measurements are made with finite resolution and over a finite time-span. The task gets even more complicated if the system is a network composed of interacting dynamical units, namely, a high-dimensional complex system. Here, we tackle this task and solve it by defining a method to approximately construct GMPs for any complex system's finite-resolution and finite-time trajectory. We critically test our method on networks of coupled maps, encoding their trajectories into symbolic sequences. We show that these sequences are optimal because they minimise the information loss and also any spurious information added. Consequently, our method allows us to approximately calculate the invariant probability measures of complex systems from the observed data. Thus, we can efficiently define complexity measures that are applicable to a wide range of complex phenomena, such as the characterisation of brain activity from electroencephalogram signals measured at different brain regions or the characterisation of climate variability from temperature anomalies measured at different Earth regions.

We found a tendency that eastward flow of information is preferred only for oceanic variables, which is a main characteristic of the ACW, an eastward wave making a circuit around the Antarctica. Since the ACW is the coherent pattern in both ocean and atmosphere it is reasonable to infer that the tendency reflects the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) encircling the Antarctica, rather than an evidence of the ACW. We observed one common feature for all four variables, a strong information flow over the area of the eastern Pacific Ocean, which suggest a signature of El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO).

  abstract      = {Concept drift detection plays a very important role in the context of data streams. It allows to point out data behavior modifications along time, which are intrinsically associated to the phenomena responsible for producing such sequences of observations. By detecting such modifications, one can better understand those phenomena and take better decisions in different application domains, e.g. stock market, climate change, population growth, etc. Besides several proposals, most of the studies lack in formal guarantees to ensure the concept drift detection. More recently, Vallim and Mello proposed 1DFT (Unidimensional Fourier Transform), an algorithm that detects drifts on unidimensional streams while holding a stability property based on surrogate series. Motivated by their work we here propose the multidimensional surrogate stability concept, which extends their approach to multidimensional data streams. In addition, our approach, named MDFT (Multidimensional Fourier Transform), employs a different and more robust measurement to analyze drifts, which is based on the Shannon's and Von Neumann's Entropies to quantify variations in data spaces. As final contribution, MDFT allows unidimensional streams, to be reconstructed in phase spaces so their data dependencies can also be analyzed to take conclusions on concept drifts along time. Experiments considered seven 120,000-observation synthetic data streams. Synthetic data was taken into account as it allows us to define the exact points of change, using the largest Lyapunov exponent, for which our approach should trigger the concept drift events. Experiments compared MDFT against the main algorithms to detect concept drift in the context of Machine Learning (Page-Hinkley Test - PHT, Adaptive Windowing - ADWIN, and Cumulative Sum Control Chart - CUSUM) and Dynamical Systems (Recurrence Quantification Analysis using different measurements - RQA, and Permutation Entropy - PE). Results confirm MDFT outperforms the other algorithms in terms of an average measurement (using the Euclidean distance) based on: the Missed Detection Rate (MDR), the Mean Time for Detection (MTD) and the Mean Time between False Alarms (MTFA).

  abstract      = {The use of information measures for model selection in geophysical models with subgrid parameterizations is examined. Although the resolved dynamical equations of atmospheric or oceanic global numerical models are well established, the development and evaluation of parameterizations that represent subgrid-scale effects pose a big challenge. For climate studies, the parameters or parameterizations are usually selected according to a root-mean-square error criterion that measures the differences between the model-state evolution and observations along the trajectory. However, inaccurate initial conditions and systematic model errors contaminate root-mean-square error measures. In this work, information theory quantifiers, in particular Shannon entropy, statistical complexity, and Jensen-Shannon divergence, are evaluated as measures of the model dynamics. An ordinal analysis is conducted using the Bandt-Pompe symbolic data reduction in the signals. The proposed ordinal information measures are examined in the two-scale Lorenz-96 system. By comparing the two-scale Lorenz-96 system signals with a one-scale Lorenz-96 system with deterministic and stochastic parameterizations, the study shows that information measures are able to select the correct model and to distinguish the parameterizations, including the degree of stochasticity that results in the closest model dynamics to the two-scale Lorenz-96 system.},

  abstract      = {Accurate model representation of land-atmosphere carbon fluxes is essential for climate projections. However, the exact responses of carbon cycle processes to climatic drivers often remain uncertain. Presently, knowledge derived from experiments, complemented by a steadily evolving body of mechanistic theory, provides the main basis for developing such models. The strongly increasing availability of measurements may facilitate new ways of identifying suitable model structures using machine learning. Here, we explore the potential of gene expression programming (GEP) to derive relevant model formulations based solely on the signals present in data by automatically applying various mathematical transformations to potential predictors and repeatedly evolving the resulting model structures. In contrast to most other machine learning regression techniques, the GEP approach generates "readable" models that allow for prediction and possibly for interpretation. Our study is based on two cases: artificially generated data and real observations. Simulations based on artificial data show that GEP is successful in identifying prescribed functions, with the prediction capacity of the models comparable to four state-of-the-art machine learning methods (random forests, support vector machines, artificial neural networks, and kernel ridge regressions). Based on real observations we explore the responses of the different components of terrestrial respiration at an oak forest in south-eastern England. We find that the GEP-retrieved models are often better in prediction than some established respiration models. Based on their structures, we find previously unconsidered exponential dependencies of respiration on seasonal ecosystem carbon assimilation and water dynamics. We noticed that the GEP models are only partly portable across respiration components, the identification of a "general" terrestrial respiration model possibly prevented by equifinality issues. Overall, GEP is a promising tool for uncovering new model structures for terrestrial ecology in the data-rich era, complementing more traditional modelling approaches.},

  abstract      = {Data analysis and model-data comparisons in the environmental sciences require diagnostic measures that quantify time series dynamics and structure, and are robust to noise in observational data. This paper investigates the temporal dynamics of environmental time series using measures quantifying their information content and complexity. The measures are used to classify natural processes on one hand, and to compare models with observations on the other. The present analysis focuses on the global carbon cycle as an area of research in which model-data integration and comparisons are key to improving our understanding of natural phenomena. We investigate the dynamics of observed and simulated time series of Gross Primary Productivity (GPP), a key variable in terrestrial ecosystems that quantifies ecosystem carbon uptake. However, the dynamics, patterns and magnitudes of GPP time series, both observed and simulated, vary substantially on different temporal and spatial scales. We demonstrate here that information content and complexity, or Information Theory Quantifiers (ITQ) for short, serve as robust and efficient data-analytical and model benchmarking tools for evaluating the temporal structure and dynamical properties of simulated or observed time series at various spatial scales. At continental scale, we compare GPP time series simulated with two models and an observations-based product. This analysis reveals qualitative differences between model evaluation based on ITQ compared to traditional model performance metrics, indicating that good model performance in terms of absolute or relative error does not imply that the dynamics of the observations is captured well. Furthermore, we show, using an ensemble of site-scale measurements obtained from the FLUXNET archive in the Mediterranean, that model-data or model-model mismatches as indicated by ITQ can be attributed to and interpreted as differences in the temporal structure of the respective ecological time series. At global scale, our understanding of C fluxes relies on the use of consistently applied land models. Here, we use ITQ to evaluate model structure: The measures are largely insensitive to climatic scenarios, land use and atmospheric gas concentrations used to drive them, but clearly separate the structure of 13 different land models taken from the CMIP5 archive and an observations-based product. In conclusion, diagnostic measures of this kind provide data-analytical tools that distinguish different types of natural processes based solely on their dynamics, and are thus highly suitable for environmental science applications such as model structural diagnostics.},

  abstract      = {Communities of benthic megafauna in the deep waters of continental shelves ({\textgreater} 100 m) are important components of marine ecosystems. In high-latitude ecosystems, this fauna is increasingly impacted by human activities and climate variability. In this study, we provide baseline knowledge on the oceanographic conditions affecting its distribution in the Barents Sea in the vicinity of the Polar Front an oceanic front occurring at the transition zone between the Atlantic and Arctic water masses. We used fields of temperature and currents from an ocean circulation model (Regional Ocean Modelling System ROMS) to derive variables divided into 3 groups relevant to bottom fauna (temperature, water column structure and bottom currents) expressing either mean conditions or temporal variability over 10 years (20012010). Benthic megafauna was surveyed in summer 2011 at 139 sites. To analyze the relationship between spatial variability in the composition of benthic megafauna (i.e., beta-diversity) and oceanographic conditions, we: (1) used generalized dissimilarity modelling (GDM) and (2) delimited oceanographic provinces (i.e., regions of similar conditions) for each group of variables using principal component analysis (PCA) followed by cluster analysis. Turnover in benthic megafauna was explained by 7 oceanographic variables (temperature: 4, water column structure: 2, bottom currents: 1), depth and geographic distance (56.7\% of total deviance explained). Concurrently, patterns in oceanographic provinces among the 3 groups of variables coincided with results from the GDM, where provinces derived from temperature were sharply delimited relative to the other groups. We concluded that the spatial structure of the environment is important in the relationship between spatial variability of benthic megafauna and oceanographic conditions in shelf deep waters. Ocean models are powerful tools to study this relationship, but the way in which their inherent uncertainty affects the conclusions of ecological models should be assessed more thoroughly.

Here we propose two methods to identify communities, and validate them with the analysis of climate datasets recorded at a regular grid of geographical locations covering the Earth surface. By identifying mutual lags among time-series recorded at different grid points, and by applying symbolic time-series analysis, we are able to extract meaningful regional communities, which can be interpreted in terms of large-scale climate phenomena. The methods proposed here are valuable tools for the study of other systems represented by networks of dynamical units, allowing the identification of communities, through time-series analysis of the observed output signals.},

Although many methods have been proposed, few papers have applied multiple methods together to detect causal relations based on time series generated from coupled nonlinear systems with some unobserved parts. Here we propose the combined use of three methods and a majority vote to infer causality under such circumstances. Two of these methods are proposed here for the first time, and all of the three methods can be applied even if the underlying dynamics is nonlinear and there are hidden common causes. We test our methods with coupled logistic maps, coupled Rossler models, and coupled Lorenz models. In addition, we show from ice core data how the causal relations among the temperature, the CH4 level, and the CO2 level in the atmosphere changed in the last 800,000 years, a conclusion also supported by irregularly sampled data analysis. Moreover, these methods show how three regions of the brain interact with each other during the visually cued, two-choice arm reaching task. Especially, we demonstrate that this is due to bottom up influences at the beginning of the task, while there exist mutual influences between the posterior medial prefrontal cortex and the presupplementary motor area. Based on our results, we conclude that identifying causality with an appropriate ensemble of multiple methods ensures the validity of the obtained results more firmly.},

We find that the rate of information production in these measurements reveals issues with analysis instruments, even when those issues leave no visible traces in the raw data.

However, dengue forecasting models based solely on local weather factors have had limited success. Hence, this paper proposes a novel dengue outbreak detection method that relies on delay permutation entropy (DPE) features extracted from daily weather data. Using data from Hong Kong between 2004 and 2015, 4383 daily DPE features have been extracted and analysed using machine learning techniques. The analysis results show that there is a strong correlation between dengue cases and rainfall DPE features. A comparison with predicted results generated from average monthly weather data, shows that the dengue outbreak detection results based on the DPE features, are up to 11\% more accurate than those predicted from the monthly average data.},

  abstract      = {An old and important problem in the field of nonlinear time-series analysis entails the distinction between chaotic and stochastic dynamics. Recently, e-recurrence networks have been proposed as a tool to analyse the structural properties of a time series. In this paper, we propose the applicability of local and global e-recurrence network measures to distinguish between chaotic and stochastic dynamics using paradigmatic model systems such as the Lorenz system, and the chaotic and hyper-chaotic Rossler system. We also demonstrate the effect of increasing levels of noise on these network measures and provide a real-world application of analysing electroencephalographic data comprising epileptic seizures. Our results show that both local and global e-recurrence network measures are sensitive to the presence of unstable periodic orbits and other structural features associated with chaotic dynamics that are otherwise absent in stochastic dynamics. These network measures are still robust at high noise levels and short data lengths. Furthermore, e-recurrence network analysis of the real-world epileptic data revealed the capability of these network measures in capturing dynamical transitions using short window sizes. e-recurrence network analysis is a powerful method in uncovering the signatures of chaotic and stochastic dynamics based on the geometrical properties of time series.},

  abstract      = {A system composed by interacting dynamical elements can be represented by a network, where the nodes represent the elements that constitute the system, and the links account for their interactions, which arise due to a variety of mechanisms, and which are often unknown. A popular method for inferring the system connectivity (i.e., the set of links among pairs of nodes) is by performing a statistical similarity analysis of the time-series collected from the dynamics of the nodes. Here, by considering two systems of coupled oscillators (Kuramoto phase oscillators and Rossler chaotic electronic oscillators) with known and controllable coupling conditions, we aim at testing the performance of this inference method, by using linear and non linear statistical similarity measures. We find that, under adequate conditions, the network links can be perfectly inferred, i.e., no mistakes are made regarding the presence or absence of links. These conditions for perfect inference require: i) an appropriated choice of the observed variable to be analysed, ii) an appropriated interaction strength, and iii) an adequate thresholding of the similarity matrix. For the dynamical units considered here we find that the linear statistical similarity measure performs, in general, better than the non-linear ones.},

  abstract      = {The inference of an underlying network topology from local observations of a complex system composed of interacting units is usually attempted by using statistical similarity measures, such as cross-correlation (CC) and mutual information (MI). The possible existence of a direct link between different units is, however, hindered within the time-series measurements. Here we show that, for the class of systems studied, when an abrupt change in the ordered set of CC or MI values exists, it is possible to infer, without errors, the underlying network topology from the time-series measurements, even in the presence of observational noise, non-identical units, and coupling heterogeneity. We find that a necessary condition for the discontinuity to occur is that the dynamics of the coupled units is partially coherent, i.e., neither complete disorder nor globally synchronous patterns are present. We critically compare the inference methods based on CC and MI, in terms of how effective, robust, and reliable they are, and conclude that, in general, MI outperforms CC in robustness and reliability. Our findings could be relevant for the construction and interpretation of functional networks, such as those constructed from brain or climate data.},

In particular, we have examined the monthly river flow time series from two rivers (the Miljacka and the Bosnia) in the mountain part of their flow and then calculated the Kolmogorov complexity (KL) based on the Lempel-Ziv Algorithm (LZA) (lower-KLL and upper-KLU), sample entropy (SE) and permutation entropy (PE) values for each time series. The results indicate that the KLL, KLU, SE and PE values in two rivers are close to each other regardless of the amplitude differences in their monthly flow rates. We have illustrated the changes in mountain river flow complexity by experiments using (i) the data set for the Bosnia River and (ii) anticipated human activities and projected climate changes. We have explored the sensitivity of considered measures in dependence on the length of time series. In addition, we have divided the period 1926-1990 into three subintervals: (a) 1926-1945, (b) 1946-1965, (c) 1966-1990, and calculated the KLL, KLU, SE, PE values for the various time series in these subintervals. It is found that during the period 1946-1965, there is a decrease in their complexities, and corresponding changes in the SE and PE, in comparison to the period 1926-1990. This complexity loss may be primarily attributed to (i) human interventions, after the Second World War, on these two rivers because of their use for water consumption and (ii) climate change in recent times.

Both types of series locate near the region of the higher complexity value in the CECP as chaotic systems, but the PE is smaller and the complexity degree is larger in the nonstationary series than the stationary with smaller time delays. Due to the close relationship between PE and the multiscale Shannon entropy, we show that the PE and CECP can be also taken as an indicator to quantify the different organization degrees of the multiscale structures existing between the stationary and nonstationary surface vertical velocity records.},

  abstract      = {The fact that the climate on the earth is a highly complex dynamical system is well-known. In the last few decades great deal of effort has been focused on understanding how climate phenomena in one geographical region affects the climate of other regions. Complex networks are a powerful framework for identifying climate interdependencies. To further exploit the knowledge of the links uncovered via the network analysis (for, e.g., improvements in prediction), a good understanding of the physical mechanisms underlying these links is required. Here we focus on understanding the role of atmospheric variability, and construct climate networks representing internal and forced variability using the output of an ensemble of AGCM runs. A main strength of our work is that we construct the networks using MIOP (mutual information computed from ordinal patterns), which allows the separation of intraseasonal, intraannual and interannual timescales. This gives further insight to the analysis of climatological data. The connectivity of these networks allows us to assess the influence of two main indices, NINO3.4 - one of the indices used to describe ENSO (El Nino-Southern oscillation) - and of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), by calculating the networks from time series where these indices were linearly removed. A main result of our analysis is that the connectivity of the forced variability network is heavily affected by " El Nino": removing the NINO3.4 index yields a general loss of connectivity; even teleconnections between regions far away from the equatorial Pacific Ocean are lost, suggesting that these regions are not directly linked, but rather, are indirectly interconnected via El Ni no, particularly at interannual timescales. On the contrary, on the internal variability network - independent of sea surface temperature (SST) forcing - the links connecting the Labrador Sea with the rest of the world are found to be significantly affected by NAO, with a maximum at intraannual timescales. While the strongest non-local links found are those forced by the ocean, the presence of teleconnections due to internal atmospheric variability is also shown.},

For this purpose we build networks from two different reanalysis data sets using both linear and nonlinear statistical similarity measures to determine the existence of links between different regions of the world in the two halves of the last century. We furthermore use symbolic analysis to emphasize intra-seasonal, intra-annual and inter-annual timescales. Both linear and nonlinear networks have similar structures and evolution, showing that the most connected regions are in the tropics over the Pacific Ocean. Also, the Southern Hemisphere extratropics have more connectivity in the first half of the 20th century, particularly on intra-annual and intra-seasonal timescales. Changes over the Pacific main connectivity regions are analyzed in more detail. Both linear and nonlinear networks show that the central and western Pacific regions have decreasing connectivity from early 1900 up to about 1940, when it starts increasing again until the present. The inter-annual network shows a similar behavior. However, this is not true of other timescales. On intra-annual timescales the minimum connectivity is around 1956, with a negative (positive) trend before (after) that date for both the central and western Pacific. While this is also true of the central Pacific on intra-seasonal timescales, the western Pacific shows a positive trend during the entire 20th century. In order to separate the internal and forced connectivity networks and to study their evolution through time, an ensemble of atmospheric general circulation model outputs is used. The results suggest that the main connectivity patterns captured in the reanalysis networks are due to the oceanically forced component, particularly on inter-annual timescales. Moreover, the atmospheric internal variability seems to play an important role in determining the intra-seasonal time-scale networks.},

Despite the large interest that climate networks have attracted, several issues remain to be investigated. Here we focus on the influence of the periodic solar forcing in climate networks constructed via similarities of monthly averaged Surface Air Temperature (SAT) anomalies. We shift the time series in each pair of nodes such as to superpose their seasonal cycles. In this way, when two nodes are located in different hemispheres we are able to quantify the similarity of SAT anomalies during the winters and during the summers. We find that data time-shifting does not significantly modify the network Area Weighted Connectivity (AWC), which is the fraction of the total area of the Earth to which each node is connected. This unexpected network property can be understood in terms of how data time-shifting modifies the strength of the links connecting geographical regions in different hemispheres, and how these modifications are washed out by averaging the AWC.

Different approaches for the transformation of the original time series to the symbolic time series have been proposed. Yet the differences between the approaches are unknown. In this study three different transformation methods are investigated: (1) symbolization according to the deviation from the average time series, (2) symbolization according to several equidistant levels between the minimum and maximum of the time series, (3) binary symbolization of the first derivative of the time series. Furthermore, permutation entropy was used to quantify the symbolic series. Each method was applied to the cardiac interbeat interval series RR (i) and its difference Delta RR (I) of 17 healthy subjects obtained during head-up tilt testing. The symbolic dynamics of each method is analyzed by means of the occurrence of short sequences ("words") of length 3. The occurrence of words is grouped according to words without variations of the symbols (0V\%), words with one variation (1V\%), two like variations (2LV\%) and two unlike variations (2UV\%). Linear regression analysis showed that for method 1 0V\%, 1V\%, 2LV\% and 2UV\% changed with increasing tilt angle. For method 2 0V\%, 2LV\% and 2UV\% changed with increasing tilt angle and method 3 showed changes for 0V\% and 1V\%. Furthermore, also the permutation entropy decreased with increasing tilt angle. In conclusion, all methods are capable of reflecting changes of the cardiac autonomic nervous system during head-up tilt. All methods show that even the analysis of very short symbolic sequences is capable of tracking changes of the cardiac autonomic regulation during head-up tilt testing.},

  abstract      = {We study global climate networks constructed by means of ordinal time series analysis. Climate interdependencies among the nodes are quantified by the mutual information, computed from time series of monthly-averaged surface air temperature anomalies, and from their symbolic ordinal representation (OP). This analysis allows identifying topological changes in the network when varying the time-interval of the ordinal pattern. We consider intra-season time-intervals (e.g., the patterns are formed by anomalies in consecutive months) and inter-annual time-intervals (e.g., the patterns are formed by anomalies in consecutive years). We discuss how the network density and topology change with these time scales, and provide evidence of correlations between geographically distant regions that occur at specific time scales. In particular, we find that an increase in the ordinal pattern spacing (i.e., an increase in the timescale of the ordinal analysis), results in climate networks with increased connectivity on the equatorial Pacific area. On the contrary, the number of significant links decreases when the ordinal analysis is done with a shorter timescale (by comparing consecutive months), and interpret this effect as due to more stochasticity in the time-series in the short timescale. As the equatorial Pacific is known to be dominated by El Nio-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on scales longer than several months, our methodology allows constructing climate networks where the effect of ENSO goes from mild (monthly OP) to intense (yearly OP), independently of the length of the ordinal pattern and of the thresholding method employed.},

In order to study their behaviour as a function of coupling strength and nonlinearity, we considered dynamics of two maps serving the combined coupling (diffusive and linear) in the above fields. Firstly, we have considered a logistic difference equation on extended domain that is a part of the maps, that is discussed using its bifurcation diagram, Lyapunov exponent, sample as well as the permutation entropy. Secondly we have performed the dynamical analysis of the coupled maps using Lyapunov exponent and cross sample entropy in dependence on two coupling parameters. Further, we investigated how dynamical noise can affects the structure of their bifurcation diagrams. It was done (i) by the noise entering in two specific ways, that disturbs either the logistic parameter on extended domain or (ii) by an additive "shock" to the state variables. Finally, we demonstrated the effect of forcing by parametric noise, introduced in all maps' parameter, on Lyapunov exponent of coupled maps. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

By setting suitable conditions we first of all consider momentary information in both time series. This enables the detection not only of coupling directions but also delays. Sorting information refers to ordinal properties of time series, which makes the analysis robust with respect to strictly monotonous distortions and thus very useful in the analysis of proxy data in climatology. Fortunately, ordinal analysis is easy and fast to compute. We consider also the problem of reliable estimation from finite time series.},

Here we investigate the complexity of temporal gene expression patterns using the concept of Permutation Entropy (PE) first introduced in dynamical systems theory. The analysis of gene expression data has so far focused primarily on the identification of differentially expressed genes, or on the elucidation of pathway and regulatory relationships. We aim to study gene expression time series data from the viewpoint of complexity. Results: Applying the PE complexity metric to abiotic stress response time series data in Arabidopsis thaliana, genes involved in stress response and signaling were found to be associated with the highest complexity not only under stress, but surprisingly, also under reference, non-stress conditions. Genes with house-keeping functions exhibited lower PE complexity. Compared to reference conditions, the PE of temporal gene expression patterns generally increased upon stress exposure. High-complexity genes were found to have longer upstream intergenic regions and more cis-regulatory motifs in their promoter regions indicative of a more complex regulatory apparatus needed to orchestrate their expression, and to be associated with higher correlation network connectivity degree. Arabidopsis genes also present in other plant species were observed to exhibit decreased PE complexity compared to Arabidopsis specific genes. Conclusions: We show that Permutation Entropy is a simple yet robust and powerful approach to identify temporal gene expression profiles of varying complexity that is equally applicable to other types of molecular profile data.},

In particular, we analyze the possible connections between changes in entropy and epochs of rapid climate change (RCC). Our results indicate that the dynamics of the ENSO proxy record during the RCC interval 9000-8000 BP displays very low entropy (high predictability) that is remarkably different from that of the other RCCs of the Holocene. Both entropy quantifiers point out to the existence of cycles with a period close to 2000 years during the mid-to-late Holocene. Within these cycles, we find a tendency for entropy to increase (predictability to decrease) during the two longer RCC periods (6000-5000 and 3500-2500 BP) which might be associated with the reported increased aridity of the low tropics.

  abstract      = {A new method named "permutation entropy" for detecting dynamical changes in time series was used to analysis the day-today temperature time series of north China from 1960a to 2000a. We detected three abrupt climate changes in the mid-1970s and early 1980s. Further analysis using Empirical Mode Decomposition to decompose the permutation entropy shows that the approximate 10a cycle is most important. So we can draw the conclusion that north China suffered three abrupt climate changes in the mid-1970s and early 1980s, and moreover, the the approximate 10a cycle induced the climate changes directly.},

  abstract      = {The study area, located in the southwest of Yunnan Province, has a distinct regional difference in both topography and climate system. Western region belongs to the Southwestern Yunnan mountainous area with varied landforms while eastern region is a part of Eastern Yunnan Plateau whose terrain is rather flat relatively. And different regions are influenced by different climates, which have resulted from the multiplicity of monsoon systems and the significance of great topographic effects. By a complexity parameter-permutation entropy for time series from 1971 to 2000 based on comparison of neighboring values, the tolerance to the complexity of climate systematic is simple and effectual. And there is a good geographical explanation of both atmospheric circulation and localized topography to climate elements.},
